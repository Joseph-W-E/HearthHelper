# HearthHelper
Just a simple project to help me learn about working with APIs. So what can it do?

# View All Existing Cards
Run queries, build decks, and so on. The initial load of this app will download a JSON of the entire code base. Each card imported will then visit the URL for the image and download that. This process should only happen once. Everything will be stored on your device so the app doesn't have to re-download everything each time the app is opened. It also allows for a significantly quicked load time of cards. If there is an update to the card library, only the selected cards will be downloaded and stored on your device.

# Easily Create Challenges / Rules
Sometimes you want to have some fun with friends. Tournament modes can easily be mimicked here. You can ban cards and classes.

# Win Tracker
Enter a deck, and after each of your games, put a win or loss against a specified deck.
